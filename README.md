# Rutgers CS Schedule Checker
 This project utilizes Spring Boot to create a REST API that allows users to download a file with information on eligible Rutgers Computer Science classes or a sample schedule for a target course based on their input. The front-end is developed with Vanilla JavaScript, while the back-end uses Node.js and Java.

The Schedule Planner Java program utilizes a depth-first search algorithm to compile a path of classes to take, given a target course. All classes are represented in an adjacency list, which the Schedule Planner program and the Eligible Classes program reference from.
